This advanced search engine empowers engineers, purchasers, and designers to efficiently locate electronic components by integrating ​multi-dimensional search capabilities and real-time supply chain insights. Designed to streamline workflows from prototyping to mass production, it supports searches via ​Manufacturer Part Number (MPN), ​vague descriptions, ​electrical parameters, and even cross-referencing equivalents.

## Component Search

HQ Search plugin will help you:

- Searcg electronic component data with quality
- Get real-time quotations from HQPCB within KiCad
- Precise search through MPN & Fuzzy Search through parameters (Eg. 5k1 5% 0805)
- Direct link to component datasheet and description page.

## Installation

- Open the "Plugin and Content Manager" from the KiCad main window. Next, find "Component Search" from "KiCad official repository" and click install.
